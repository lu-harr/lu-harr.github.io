Welcome to my website! Now with added [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)

TODO

- WIMSIG game needs its own *post* with download link ...
    - there was a good picture of the game on someone's twitter that I could link to?
    - old idea: "Random woman in maths" button - floating picture of card design that flips to reveal card, click link to answer
- Add posts for papers
- Add links from publications page to paper-specific posts? Or have publications as a separate collection? Not really sure how collections work yet ...
    - OR have *project* pages: ZOOMAL, jev, MARCSE, etc. not currently in use
- Add acknowledgement of country to PhD section
- hidden recipes/hairdressing testimonials because that would amuse me
- (Populate project pages)
- Add list of lectures/tutorials to teaching page as part of dynamic resume? Even if I don't upload the actual resources, visitors probably expect the "teaching" page to have that sort of information?
