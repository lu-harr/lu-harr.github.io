Welcome to my website! Now with added [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) ... still experiencing some teething issues ...

TODO

- WIMSIG game needs its own *post* with download link ...
    - there was a good picture of the game on someone's twitter that I could link to?
    - old idea: "Random woman in maths" button - floating picture of card design that flips to reveal card, click link to answer
- Multicriteria paper needs its own *post*
- Add links from publications page to paper-specific posts? Or have publications as a separate collection? Not really sure how collections work yet ...
    - OR have *project* pages: ZOOMAL, jev, WWARN, etc.
- Add acknowledgement of country to PhD section
- hidden recipes/hairdressing testimonials because that would amuse me
- want to land on "about" (change "about" to "hello!") and keep "recent posts" as the thing that comes up on "posts" ... and maybe change "posts" to "blog" or decide if I want to partitition things out ...
