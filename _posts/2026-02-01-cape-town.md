It's been fantastic to catch up with collaborators from the MARC SE-Africa consortium this week in Cape Town for a very timely writing retreat. I'm aiming to have my current MARCSE manuscript ready for submission in a couple of weeks and I've been very inspired by the setting and the opportunity to meet with everyone in person! We took a break after a full day of writing and discussion to visit the African penguins. I was invited to run a workshop on visualising data - I don't need asking twice on this topic! Slides are here: ["Visualising data and other horror stories"](https://lu-harr.github.io/_pages/teaching/visualisation_workshop_v2.pdf)
