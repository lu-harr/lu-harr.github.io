I recently travelled to Byron Bay to speak at the final meeting of SPECTRUM. I was awarded the prize for best student talk for a presentation on my final PhD project, finding candidate optimal sites for Japanese encephalitis virus surveillance in mosquitoes. This project has well and truly evolved since I first presented it at ANZIAM in February.
      
I also attended and presented at the WIMSIG (Women and gender diverse people in Maths Special Interest Group) meeting last week, at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. This meeting was a fantastic opporunity to meet with friends and make new friends in the community of women and gender diverse mathematicians working in Australia. Together with my office buddy, Isobel Abell, I co-organised a special session, titled *Modelling for Decision-Making*. Our special session was a great forum of people working across a collection of different domains, including biosecurity, bushfire science, workforce optimisation and epidemiology. WIMSIG was the perfect venue for a couple of PhD students to organise a session with talks and discussion on a topic that is of great interest to us!
