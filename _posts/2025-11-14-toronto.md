I was quite privileged to travel to Toronto for the 2025 meeting of the American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. It's been a little odd walking to a tropical medicine meeting in the snow! I was included in two symposia for this meeting: firstly, to present at a symposium celebrating the wrap-up of the ZOOMAL consortium, which included presentations on the consortium's work on the *Plasmodium knowlesi* vectors, wildlife hosts, parasite genetics, and health economics. It was fantastic to catch up with all of the ZOOMAL team that made it all the way to Toronto!

My primary purpose in Toronto was to present my current research developing spatiotemporal models of molecular markers for antimalarial drug resistance in Africa, as part of a symposium highlighting progress made by the MARC SE-Africa consortium. Our symposium was well-attended and it was exciting to meet with so many scientists investigating antimalarial drug resistance, in light of the increasing number of countries in Africa where artemisinin partial resistance has been confirmed.
