I presented a seminar for the Applied Malaria Modelling Network (AMMNet) yesterday, on *Structured decision making with geospatial modelling outputs*. 

The talk focused on a *P. knowlesi* malaria human surveillance case study from north-west Indonesia. This setting is quite different to malaria transmission settings in other parts of the world: many endemic countries are approaching malaria elimination and the involvement of macaque hosts and likely influence of land use and land cover over interactions between the species involved in transmission represent further complexities.
