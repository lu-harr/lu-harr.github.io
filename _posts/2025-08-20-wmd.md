I've written up a short piece for World Mosquito Day (20th August)! Have a read of it on the University of Oxford's news page, [here](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/features/tracking-resistance-mapping-spread-drug-resistant-malaria).

In other good news, the first part of our geospatial assessment of Japanese encephalitis virus risk in Australia is now in [preprint](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/jhqv6_v1) form!
