I'm getting close to completing my PhD, so it was time for my completion seminar. There might have been some fresh figures in my slides that my supervisors haven't seen yet! While I'm still a couple of months from submitting my thesis, the process of putting the seminar together has been very helpful to thinking about its overall contention and how each of my chapters contributes to it.
