In the summer of 2019--2020, I worked on a mechanistic model of the Australian 
neurology workforce as part of an internship with the Clinical Outcomes Research Unit (CORe)
at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. This model was eventually written up by other
CORe collaborators and [published](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10151858/) 
in *BMJ neurology open*. And in 2023, it was covered by 
[The Limbic](https://thelimbic.com/neurology/neurologist-workforce-crisis-developing-in-australia-anzan-research/) - 
this was only brought to my attention this week, but it's very cool that a little summer
project has evolved into something that has reached a wider audience than all the lovely
people I met during my time with CORe!
