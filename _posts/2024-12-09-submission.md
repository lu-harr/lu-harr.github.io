I have now started my postdoc with the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory at the University of Oxford. It was perhaps a foolish time of year to move from Australia to Oxford - see attached picture of a frosty Headington shark. I submitted my thesis in early November and now am waiting to hear the outcome of its examination. I jumped on a plane only a couple of weeks after submitting!
