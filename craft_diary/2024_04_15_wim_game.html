    <h3>Women and gender diverse people in maths: the card game</h3>

    <p>For my first entry in this crafty section of my website, I introduce <b>Women and gender diverse people in maths: the card game</b>! I made this deck of cards with my friends from the maths and computing community at the University of Melbourne, <b>Isobel Abell, Adriana Zanca, Punya Alakahoon</b> and <b>Jennifer Flegg</b>. <b>TK Le</b> made the lovely artwork for the rear side of the cards.</p>
    
    <p>This "card game" was created to start a conversation about the women and gender diverse people who have contributed to mathematics from ancient and more recent history - we aimed to include some well-known people and some mathematicians who are much less well-recognised. The cards in our deck are like Christmas cracker activities - read out the hints to your friends and see if you can guess who the card is describing! Scan the QR code on each card for the answer. If the mathematician is someone you've never heard about before, read on and find out something new!</p>
