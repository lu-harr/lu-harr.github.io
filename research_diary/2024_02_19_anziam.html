    <h3>2024-02-19: ANZIAM</h3>

    <p>I presented some new research at the ANZIAM conference held in Hahndorf, South Australia, last week. I have been exploring the use of  iterative optimisation methods (e.g. simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) for multi-objective site selection problems and presented an application of these methods to the selection of sites for surveillance of Japanese encephalitis in mosquitoes.</p>
    
    <p>I also helped to organise some activities for the Women In Maths Special Interest Group's annual ANZIAM lunch. This year, we aimed to make the lunch a positive celebration of women and gender diverse people in maths. With the help of my peers, I created a card game of clues relating to well-known and less recognised women and non-binary people who have made contributions to mathematics. It was great seeing everyone engage with the game over lunch. A highlight of the conference! Find out more details about the game <a href="./craft_diary#2024-04-15-game">here</a>.</p>
