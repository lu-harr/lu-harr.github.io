- *Using geospatial models to select primary healthcare centres for surveillance of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria* (LH first author)  \
Disease surveillance produces critical information on disease prevalence, incidence and clinical outcomes, however it is limited by available resources and should be carefully planned. The spatial distribution of risk of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria in north-western Indonesia is not well understood. However, numerous studies have linked disease risk to environments where humans, macaque hosts and mosquito vectors interact, on the forest fringe and in croplands and plantations. We present a flexible framework for the selection of primary healthcare centres for targeted disease surveillance, applied to the surveillance of <i>P. knowlesi</i> malaria in north-western Indonesia. We consider several definitions of healthcare centre catchment area, and explore a number of possible objectives for disease surveillance, incorporating the outputs of a geospatial model of disease risk. These objectives can be optimised for individual sites or complete surveillance designs, and can be optimised independently or simultaneously, in a multi-objective decision problem.  \

- *Appraisal and iterative selection of sites for surveillance of Japanese encephalitis virus in mosquitoes* (LH first author)  \

Japanese encephalitis virus in mosquitoes, drawing on the outputs described in 
reports to government.  \
With Freya Shearer, Jennifer Flegg, David Price, David Duncan, Nick Golding and others.
  
- *Gender representation at mathematics conferences in Australia: all a matter of perception?*  \
We all seek to improve gender representation in mathematics academia, but do we all share the same understanding of the current state of affairs? Are there biases unique to each of us that change our individual perception of gender representation? Anecdotal evidence suggests gender and age shape an individual's perception of gender representation and therefore their commitment to the advancement of gender equality, however a quantitative dataset for the Australian mathematics community does not exist. With the support of local mathematics and statistics societies, we aim to evaluate the current state of gender representation at mathematics and statistics conferences.  \
