## Preamble

Giving a poster presentation at a conference is a great opportunity to get your work out there! Here's a workshop of helpful hints and tips to make up a great poster!

## Some resources

There is lots of advice out there:

1. An outreach librarian at the Bod has a great set of slides: <https://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/bodreader/documents/media/iskills-designing-conference-poster.pdf>
2. 

## Making a plan

### Audience

Before you start

### Layout

**Consider reading flow:**

Imagine you are reading your poster, or ask someone with fresh eyes to read it: does the natural order your audience reads your poster in match your expectation?

This ain't working :(

## Miscellaneous tips

- Don't forget to acknowledge co-authors/research groups/sponsors/grants involved in supporting your work (e.g., with a logo for a grant/sponsor)

- Include a QR code to your website/linkedIn/preprint - if your audience has bookmarked you, they're more likely to remember your research at a later date!

- Once you have a draft, stand back! Imagine your draft at A0 size, across the other end of Radcliffe square - 

## Some examples

Here are some example posters from me + my friends :)

Let's discuss:

- Who is the audience of each of these posters?
- What do these posters do well?
- Where could these posters improve?
