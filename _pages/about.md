I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.iddo.org">Infectious 
Diseases Data Observatory</a> (IDDO), at the University of Oxford. As part of 
the <a href="https://www.iddo.org/wwarn">Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance 
Network</a> (WWARN), and in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.marcse-africa.org">Mitigating Antimalarial 
Resistance Consortium in South-East Africa</a> (MARC SE-Africa),
I am constructing geospatial models of molecular markers for antimalarial drug 
resistance in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria in Africa.

Until 2024, I was a PhD student in the School of Maths and Stats at 
the University of Melbourne, in the <a href="https://mathematical-biology.science.unimelb.edu.au">Melbourne 
Mathematical Biology</a> Group. My thesis explored structured decision-making 
using geospatial modelling outputs. During my PhD, I applied methods of 
structured decision-making to models of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria in 
Indonesia, antimalarial resistance in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in India 
and Japanese encephalitis virus in Australia.
