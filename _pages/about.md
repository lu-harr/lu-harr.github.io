I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://www.iddo.org">Infectious Diseases Data Observatory</a> (IDDO), at the University of Oxford. As part of the <a href="https://www.iddo.org/wwarn">Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network</a> (WWARN), I am constructing geospatial models of antimalarial drug resistance in Africa.

Until November 2024, I was a PhD student in the School of Maths and Stats at the University of Melbourne, in the <a href="https://mathematical-biology.science.unimelb.edu.au">Melbourne Mathematical Biology</a> Group. My thesis explores structured decision making using geospatial modelling outputs. During my PhD, I applied methods of structured decision making to models of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria in Indonesia, antimalarial resistance in <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> in India and Japanese encephalitis virus in Australia.
